# Daily-Planner
Stores data to help you plan out your day.

# Usage
The planner persistantly stores data when you hit the save button next to each timeslot.
The timeslots contain an input text-field in the middle for each hour during normal working hours, simply click on the input area and type notes or tasks into the field.

Then click the save button on the right hand side to save the task to local storage in your browser. The same tasks will be loaded again when the program is opened.

# Colors
The input fields change color based on what time of day it is. They turn green for tasks in the future, red for tasks in the current hour, and grey for tasks in the past. The program automatically changes to the correct color when you refresh the page.

# moddability
The program automatically starts at 9AM to 5PM, which is done with an array length controlled loop, if you were to make the array longer it would go past 5PM. Though going earlier than 9AM might be a bit more difficult.
